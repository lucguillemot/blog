<p>My name is Luc Guillemot, I am a cartographer and a social scientist interested in political geography, urbanism and spatial relations of any kind. I recently received a doctoral degree in Architecture and Sciences of the city from the Swiss federal institute of technology in Lausanne (EPFL). I am currently a postdoc scholar at UC Berkeley Geography where I investigate the relation between residential choices and political beliefs. I am looking at the political significance of urban (or non-urban) settings as both the cause (the reason for moving in) and the result (as a consequence of local politics) of the idea of society that leads to a residential choice.
