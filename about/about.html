<p>My name is Luc Guillemot, I am a cartographer and a social scientist interested in political geography, urbanism and spatial relations of any kind. I recently received a doctoral degree in Architecture and Sciences of the city from the Swiss federal institute of technology in Lausanne (EPFL). I am currently a postdoc scholar at UC Berkeley Geography. This site hosts a selection of research projects centered on data visualization.
